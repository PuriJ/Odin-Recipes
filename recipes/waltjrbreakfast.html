                    <li>
                        Place the egg yolks and milk in a large bowl, sift over the flour, 
                        caster sugar and salt and mix well. Whisk the egg whites in a clean 
                        grease-free bowl until they form soft peaks. Fold into the flour mixture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Heat a little oil in a large frying pan. Drop two to three large spoonfuls 
                        of the pancake mixture into the hot pan and cook for 2 mins until crisp and 
                        golden. Turn over and cook for a further 1 min until golden. Transfer to a 
                        clean tea towel to keep warm. Cook the remaining batter in the same way to 
                        make 12 pancakes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cook the bacon under a hot grill for 3-4 mins, turning once until crisp. 
                        Beat the eggs and milk together with plenty of seasoning. Melt the butter 
                        in a non-stick pan, add the eggs and cook over a low heat for 2 mins, 
                        stirring until the eggs scramble and are cooked to your liking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To serve, pile two or three warm pancakes on each plate, and serve with 
                        the bacon and scrambled egg.
